                Forget a person is how the pain. Forget that a person is how uncomfortable. In life, we will certainly
                encounter lots of
                obstacles and difficulties there must have many memorable things, unforgettable person. Miss a person,
                but not his
                heart, love a person, but broke my heart. The original miss a person, how much happiness, at least I
                don't know who is
                in his heart.
